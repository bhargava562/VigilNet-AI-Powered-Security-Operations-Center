(Assumed Video Length: 5-7 minutes. Adjust pacing as needed.)

[0:00-0:15] Introduction & Hook

(Visual: Start with a dynamic shot of your Streamlit dashboard in action – maybe a time-lapse of alerts appearing, or a quick pan over the key metrics. Include your project logo if you have one.)
Narrator: "Hello, judges! We are Team [Your Team Name], and this is VigilNet, an intelligent, agent-powered Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) dashboard designed to combat modern cyber threats."
Narrator: "In today's digital landscape, organizations are drowning in security data, struggling to identify real threats amidst the noise. VigilNet offers a glimpse into a proactive, automated future of cybersecurity."
[0:15-0:45] Problem Statement

(Visual: Show a busy, overwhelming screen of raw log data or a graphic depicting data overload and a frustrated analyst.)
Narrator: "The problem is clear: modern IT environments generate an explosion of security events from countless sources – endpoints, networks, user activity, cloud applications. This leads to:"
"Information Overload: Security teams are overwhelmed by sheer volume."
"Alert Fatigue: Too many false positives obscure real attacks."
"Slow Response: Manual analysis means critical threats are often missed or responded to too late."
Narrator: "Organizations need a way to intelligently process this data, detect subtle anomalies, and respond rapidly and automatically. That's where VigilNet comes in."
[0:45-1:15] Solution Overview

(Visual: Transition to a clean shot of your Streamlit dashboard, highlighting the key sections as you talk – dashboard metrics, event stream, alerts table, actions table.)
Narrator: "VigilNet provides a centralized, agent-driven platform for automated security monitoring and incident response. It tackles these challenges by:"
"Consolidating Data: It brings together security events from diverse sources into one intelligent system."
"Automated Anomaly Detection: Our specialized agents proactively scan for suspicious patterns, flagging what humans would typically miss."
"Intelligent Alerting: It correlates related anomalies into actionable alerts, reducing noise and focusing on genuine threats."
"Automated Response: For critical threats, it triggers immediate, predefined response actions, minimizing attack impact."
"Real-time Visibility: The intuitive dashboard provides a live operational picture of security events and alerts."
[1:15-3:45] Project Workflow: From Start to Agents (Detailed)

(Visual: A simple diagram showing the flow: streamlit run app.py -> app.py loads configs/managers -> data_simulator.py generates data -> app.py reads data -> agents process -> Orchestrator -> Alerts/Actions -> Dashboard. Then show the specific sections on the dashboard as you describe agents.)

Narrator: "Let's dive into VigilNet's workflow. The project begins by running streamlit run app.py from your terminal."

app.py (The Core Application): "This is our main Streamlit application file. It's responsible for setting up our configuration (config.py), initializing the AlertManager and VigilNetApp for logging, and most importantly, rendering our entire interactive dashboard."
config.py & .env (Configuration): "These files define all the project's settings, like anomaly detection thresholds, simulation parameters, and even authentication credentials. They're loaded at startup to configure our agents and the simulation."
alert_manager.py (Central Hub): "This crucial component acts as the central database for all generated Alert objects and SimulatedActions. It manages their lifecycle, allowing us to retrieve, update, and persist them throughout the application's runtime."
utils/data_processor.py (Data Handling): "This module is responsible for reading our security events from their source – currently, our simulated data files – and transforming them into a standardized SecurityEvent format for our agents to consume."
data_simulator.py (Event Generator): "This independent script is our source of simulated security events. When you click 'Generate New Data' on the dashboard, this script runs in the background, creating realistic log entries and injecting specific anomalies like 'port_scan' or 'malware_exec' into the data files for our agents to find."
Narrator: "Now, let's talk about the intelligent heart of VigilNet: Our Agents! Each agent plays a specialized role in our security pipeline:"

Endpoint Agent (in agents/endpoint_agent.py):

What it does: "This agent is designed to monitor activities occurring on individual computers or servers, referred to as 'endpoints.' It looks for signs of compromise or unusual resource usage."
When it's called: "It processes SecurityEvents related to process_creation, cpu_utilization, file_access, and registry_access."
Example Action: "If a process with a suspicious name like 'malware.exe' is created, or a CPU utility goes above our defined threshold, the Endpoint Agent detects an anomaly."
Network Agent (in agents/network_agent.py):

What it does: "The Network Agent focuses on detecting suspicious patterns in network traffic within our simulated environment."
When it's called: "It processes SecurityEvents related to network_connection, data_transfer, dns_query, and netflow_event."
Example Action: "It will flag anomalies like a 'port_scan' attempt or unusually large 'data_transfer' events that might indicate data exfiltration."
User Behavior Agent (in agents/user_behavior_agent.py):

What it does: "This agent monitors user activities to identify patterns indicative of account compromise or insider threats."
When it's called: "It processes SecurityEvents like user_login_attempt, app_usage, web_activity, and user_activity_event."
Example Action: "If it sees a sudden 'login_failure_spike' for a single user, or a login from an 'unusual_login_time', it generates an anomaly."
Orchestrator Agent (in agents/orchestrator_agent.py):

What it does: "This is our master agent, the central brain of VigilNet. It receives anomalies from all other specialized agents."
When it's called: "It's continuously processing the anomalies generated by the Endpoint, Network, and User Behavior Agents."
Example Action: "If the Endpoint Agent reports a 'malware_exec' anomaly AND the Network Agent reports an 'unusual_network_connection' for the same host, the Orchestrator Agent will correlate these into a higher-fidelity, 'Critical' alert like 'Potential Ransomware Infection with C2 Communication'. For such critical alerts, it then triggers a SimulatedAction such as 'isolate_host' – demonstrating automated response."
Narrator: "All these alerts and simulated actions are then centrally managed by our AlertManager and displayed live on the Streamlit dashboard."

[3:45-5:45] What Action I Perform (Current State) vs. Real-Time Potential

(Visual: Transition to a screen shot showing the "Generate New Data" button and the simulation progress.)

Narrator: "For this hackathon, our input comes from simulated security event logs. Instead of connecting to a live company's infrastructure, I perform the action of clicking 'Generate New Data & Restart Simulation'."

(Highlight the button): "This runs our data_simulator.py script, which creates fresh log files filled with various security events and pre-defined anomalies. It's like pressing 'play' on a pre-recorded security incident scenario."
"Once the data is generated, I then click 'Start Simulation'. This initiates VigilNet's processing loop, where it continuously reads events from these simulated files, and our agents analyze them in near real-time, just as they would with live data."
(Highlight the dashboard updating): "The dashboard updates dynamically, showing you the alerts and actions as they are 'detected' in the simulated stream."
Narrator: "So, the key action I perform is controlling the simulation's input and flow, providing a perfect demonstration environment for our agents' capabilities."

(Visual: Now, transition to a conceptual diagram of real-time data flow: Actual Systems -> Log Collectors -> Message Queue -> VigilNet Agents -> DB -> Dashboard. Add logos for example tools like Splunk/ELK, Kafka, AWS/GCP services.)

Narrator: "Now, let's talk about real-time application. If VigilNet were to protect a real company, for example, 'GlobalTech Solutions Inc.', here's how it would connect:"

"Instead of our data_simulator.py, VigilNet would integrate with live data sources and APIs. This would involve connecting to:"
Endpoint Logging APIs: From EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne, or native OS log forwarding (e.g., Windows Event Log subscriptions, Linux rsyslog) pushing directly to a centralized collector or message queue."
Network Flow Data (NetFlow/IPFIX) & Firewall APIs: From network devices like Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, or Fortinet.
Cloud Audit Logs: APIs from Google Cloud Audit Logs, AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor.
Identity Provider Logs: From Okta, Active Directory, or other identity management systems.
Crucially, we'd use real-time message brokers like Apache Kafka or cloud-native solutions like Google Cloud Pub/Sub or AWS Kinesis as the pipeline for these live events. Log forwarders on client systems would send data to these queues, and VigilNet's data_processor would then consume from them."
"This means VigilNet would be constantly 'listening' to GlobalTech Solutions' entire digital footprint, detecting threats as they occur, providing genuine real-time security intelligence."
[5:45-6:30] How My Project Solves the Problem (Reiteration & Impact)

(Visual: Return to your dashboard, emphasizing the metrics and alert table.)
Narrator: "By simulating these real-world scenarios, VigilNet clearly demonstrates its ability to solve the core cybersecurity problems:"
"It reduces information overload by intelligently filtering raw events into actionable anomalies and alerts."
"It enables proactive detection through specialized, always-on agents."
"It facilitates rapid response through automated actions, minimizing the window of attack."
"Ultimately, VigilNet transforms overwhelming security data into clear, actionable intelligence, empowering security teams to protect their organizations more effectively."
